# MOEA_diagnostics_for_financial_risk_management
Repository for Gupta, Hamilton, Reed, &amp; Characklis, 2020, "Can Modern Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms Discover High-Dimensional Financial Risk Portfolio Tradeoffs for Snow-Dominated Water-Energy Systems?" (in prep)

This repository contains all code needed to run the diagnostics experiments and generate data. The raw data are exluded due to size constraints, but the data that is ultimately needed to create figures is provided in the respective figure folders.

Note: Two missing files are:

1) Borg.jar that resides in ./code/lib, which is a Java version of the Borg Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (http://borgmoea.org/), a licensed software. For the .jar file, please contact: rg727@cornell.edu. Alternatively, the diagnostics can be performed without Borg, using any of the standard algorithms in the MOEAFramework: http://moeaframework.org/javadoc/org/moeaframework/algorithm/StandardAlgorithms.html 

2) HHSamp11122018.txt which can be found at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKbrKztGQgz6AWbVi3yLJCGWBqCBSIfd/view?usp=sharing
